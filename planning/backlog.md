## Must-Haves

> First page - Home page

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `logo`, `title` and `description` so that I
      can understand easily what the website is all about.

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `Navigation links`, so I can go to the
      different parts of the page.

- [ ] As a user I want to see at the end of the page a `footer` with some info
      for copyright notice, privacy policy

> Second page - Intro

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `intro` just to have an idea about you

> Third page - About Me

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `about you` and or `image(s)` so I get to know
      you better

> Fourth page - Blog and Project page

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `blogs` and or `projects` you have done

> Fifth page - Contact

- [ ] As a user I want to see the `contact form` and or `email add` so I can
      easily contact you
